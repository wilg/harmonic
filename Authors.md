History & Authors
----------------- 

Harmonic was a sort of pet project, built on-and-off over several years by [Wil Gieseler](http://wil.gieseler.org/) ([supapuerco](https://github.com/supapuerco/) on GitHub) through Mindquirk.
After Wil closed [Mindquirk](http://mindquirk.com/), he gently opened his code for We the People to maintain it if possible.

[Matti Schneider-Ghibaudo](http://mattischneider.fr) then updated it when iTunes 10 broke compatibility, and is its on-and-off maintainer since he published his fork as the update stream in services like iUseThis.

[kawazoe](https://github.com/kawazoe) fixed important crashes and leaks in the Objective-C plugin.
